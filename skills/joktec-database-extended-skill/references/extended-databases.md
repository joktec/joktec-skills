# Extended Database Usage

## Package Boundaries

Extended database packages expose reusable clients and helpers for specific data systems. They should not contain consumer app schemas or business-specific query policy.

## Notes

- Elastic may depend on `@joktec/http` for HTTP-backed behavior.
- Arango and BigQuery are separate client packages; verify the README/source before assuming repository-like CRUD support.
- Use local package tests or consumer harnesses only when the target service stack is available.
